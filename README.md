## 💡 Introduction?

**Evenly** is a modern, open-source finance tracking app **built for individuals and couples** who believe in growing together through financial clarity.

- Evenly lets you track everyday expense across personal and household expense
- Monitor and setup recurring bills, budgets, and financial habits
- Visualize your income vs. savings with simple monthly summaries
- Maintain transparency, not tension — and avoid spreadsheet chaos

Think of it as your **personal finance dashboard** — focused on **clarity, reflection, and collaboration** between partners.


## 🚀 Why Evenly?

Most personal finance apps:

- Are **built for individuals**, not couples.
- Require **bank linking** or track your data behind the scenes. Some even ask for credentials for getting your EPF data !!
- Are often focused on **selling financial products** like credit cards, insurance, or securities

**Evenly** is different. It started as usecase for my personal learning and personal
use to track financial information with my wife. **How is it** different?

✅ 100% self-hostable - you own your data
✅ Works offline or in your own private cloud  
✅ Designed around **collaboration and conversation**, not isolation  
✅ Built with ❤️ by people who want financial transparency to feel human
✅ Because it’s not just about splitting bills — it’s about working *evenly* toward shared goals. Whether you're tracking expenses, managing investments, or planning for the future, Evenly helps couples grow together — with clarity, transparency, and trust.
