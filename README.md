## 💡 What is Evenly?

**Evenly** is a modern, open-source finance management app **built for couples** who want to:

- Split expenses fairly (even when they're not 50-50)
- Track investments, recurring bills, and shared goals
- Understand income vs. spending with simple summaries
- Maintain transparency and teamwork — not spreadsheets

Think of it as **Splitwise meets Groww**, but private, quirky, and self-hosted.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is **unfinished** and currently under active development.  
> It started as a personal, educational experiment — but we believe it has real potential for actual use by couples.  
> Expect rapid changes, incomplete features, and lots of 💡 in-progress work.

## 🚀 Why Evenly?

Most personal finance apps:

- Are **built for individuals**, not couples
- Have **invasive tracking or require linking bank accounts**
- Don’t support **uneven splits** or collaborative insights
- Are **not free or self-hostable**

Evenly changes that:

✅ 100% self-hostable  
✅ Works offline or in your own cloud  
✅ Designed around **collaboration and conversation**, not isolation  
✅ Built with ❤️ by people who want financial transparency to feel human
